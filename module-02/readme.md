# About module 2

As module 2 try using mlflow, I made a virtualenvs. The packages that needed in requirements.txt

## How to run using Pipfile
- make sure to instal pipfile
- run command 'pipenv install' because we have Pipfile
- pipenv run

**Notes for myself**
- If we only have requirements.txt and doesn't have Pipfile, we can run command:

`pipenv install -r requirements.txt`
